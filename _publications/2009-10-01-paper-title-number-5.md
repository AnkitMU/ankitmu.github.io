The Object Constraint Language (OCL) is extensively used in model-driven engineering to specify constraints
on UML class diagrams. Evaluating the complexity of OCL expressions remains a challenge, particularly in the
context of verification. This paper introduces a complete new set of metrics for measuring OCL expressions. This
gives us the advantage of measuring OCL in a customizable way. First, we enhance the Structural Complexity.
Second, we propose two new types of metric: Computational and Dependency Complexity. Finally, we calculate
the overall complexity using our Total Complexity metric. Our experimental results demonstrate how one can
measure the complexity of an OCL benchmark in terms of its verification time which is used to define the weights
for OCL constructs.
